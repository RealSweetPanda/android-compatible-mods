# Android Compatible Mods

A list of mods that are compatible (or not!) with Android SMAPI.

## Where to see the list

It's linked on the sidebar twice, but it's [https://android.stardew.rocks](https://android.stardew.rocks)

## How to submit a mod

1. Create an issue at [the issues tab](https://github.com/stardewrocks/android-compatible-mods/issues)
2. Make sure to include the following information:
    - Mod name
    - UniqueID
    - Working Status (`not_working`, `alternate_version`, `fully`, `old_version`)
    - Working Download link
    - Latest Download link
    - Working version (of the mod)
    - Latest version (of the mod)
    - Your SMAPI log (view details at <https://smapi.io/log>)
3. Submit the issue and wait for it to be approved

If you are knowledgeable in JSON and understand how `src/lib/mods/data.json` works, feel free to submit a PR.

If you have an existing list and want to cross-reference, the CSV of non-XNB mods on Nexusmods (as of 28/6/23) that I compiled based on Pathoschild's mod dump can be found [here](lib/mods/smapi-mods-on-nexus-28_6_23.csv)
